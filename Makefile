# Simple Makefile
# Mike Lam, James Madison University, August 2015
#
# This makefile builds a simple application that contains a main module
# (specified by the EXE variable) and a predefined list of additional modules
# (specified by the MODS variable). If there are any external library
# dependencies (e.g., the math library, "-lm"), list them in the LIBS variable.
#
# For easier debugging and testing, this makefile can be set up to run the
# program in addition to compiling it. To do this, use the "run" or "cleanrun"
# targets (the latter also runs the "clean" target to force a rebuild). To
# change how the compiled executable is executed, modify the "run" target.
#
# This version of the Makefile includes support for building a test suite. The
# recommended framework is Check (http://check.sourceforge.net/). To build and
# run the test suite, execute the "test" target. The test suite must be located
# in a module called "testsuite". There are provisions for separate compilation
# and linking flags for building the test suite.
#
# To change the default build target (which executes when you just type
# "make"), change the right-hand side of the definition of the "default"
# target.
#
# By default, this makefile will build the project with debugging symbols and
# without optimization. To change this, edit or remove the "-g" and "-O0"
# options in CFLAGS and LDFLAGS accordingly.
#
# By default, this makefile build the application using the GNU C compiler,
# adhering to the C99 standard with all warnings enabled.
