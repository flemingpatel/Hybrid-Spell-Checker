# Hybrid-Spell-Checker
Implemented a Hybrid spell checker using Trie data structure in C Language.

1.)	Developed a command line argument-based Linux console program using C Language. That can load a dictionary to memory and read text
	file, checking each word against the dictionary. If the word is not part of the dictionary, it would report the line number where
	the word was encountered and wrongly spell word.
2.)	Moreover, at the end it would report the number of misspelled words, the number of words in the dictionary, the number of words in
	the text and, Execution time (how long does it take to execute multiple functions).
3.)	It has used - Data Structure concepts such as Linked List, Trie Data Structure to stored dictionary words and made very efficient
	function to manipulate the data structure.
4.)	It has also used Manually compile individual .c files, then link them together to create an executable. Moreover, we implemented
	command line arguments and made our own 3 options for the program.
